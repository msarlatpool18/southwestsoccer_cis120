<h3>How Southwest College was founded</h3>
<p>Born in Council Bluffs, Iowa to a well-known family of farmers in 1878, Paul Jackson was raised on 
the notion that all of the secrets of the universe were held in the soil on their farm. His family knew 
of nothing else because there was no need to drive into town or get to know the name of their neighbors 
when the closest people were miles apart. Graduating in 1897 from a local high school, Jackson went to 
peruse a business degree with a minor in education in one of the big state colleges. What he graduated 
with was with a college diploma and a desire to go back to his home of rural Iowa with the encouragement 
and inspiration from the type of people he met out in the world</p>

<p>Southwest College originated in 1913 from the hard work of Jackson's drive to create a community out 
of his town, which started in an abandoned building on the outskirts of town. After many years of struggle
 with finances and difficulties with gathering a following from other communities and his own town, SWC 
 was finally recognized as a public institution of higher learning.</p>
